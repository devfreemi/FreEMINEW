					<p>** - GST as applicable</p>
					<p>* - It is noteworthy that the above mentioned NAV or Net Assets Value and the date, are the last reported NAV as per available with RTA/BSEStARMF for the specified date which is not relevant to the order that you will be going to place. The NAV which is applicable to your order will be dependent on the fund type and the time you are going to place the order. As an example- If you have placed a purchase order in a Non-liquid fund on a business day before the cutoff time 1415 hrs on RTA/BSEStARMF then the order will be processed at the NAV which prevails at the closing of the business day. However the orders that are placed on that business day after the cutoff time of 1415 hrs or is placed on a Non-Business day, the applicable NAV will be of the next business day.</p>
					<p># - According to SEBI guidelines and norms, the cutoff time for accepting the orders in Liquid funds is 1300 hrs and Non-liquid funds is 14 hrs 15 mins. But considering the account internal transaction processing time, RTA/BSEStARMF has set the redemption and switch out from Liquid funds( to get historic Net Asset Value "NAV") as 1400 hrs and for accepting purchasing, redemption and switch out from all orders in Non-liquid funds as 14 hrs 15 mins. The applicable NAV is applied for all orders that are placed within the RTA/BSEStARMF cut-off time. However any orders that are placed before the SEBI mandated cut-off time but post the RTA/BSEStARMF cut-off time, shall be processed on the best efforts basis for the applicable NAV.</p>
