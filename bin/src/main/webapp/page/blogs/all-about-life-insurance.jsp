                <p><strong><u>All about Life Insurance </u></strong></p>
<p>1.What is life insurance? - Under life insurance, the subject matter of insurance is human life. Under life insurance, human life is insured against various risks like death, accident etc. Life insurance is basically for legal heirs of the person insured (i.e; legal heirs of the person on whom the life insurance is taken). So in event of death of the person insured, the insurance amount goes to the legal heirs.</p>
<p>2.What are various types of life insurance?</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;<strong>First Whole Life Policy</strong> - Under this policy, whole life of a person is insured. The person who is insured, cannot receive any amount under this policy. The insurance amount is paid to the nominee or the legal heirs on the death of the person insured. The rate of premium is very low in case of whole life policy.</li>
<li><strong>Second is Term Plan</strong> - Term Plan is very similar to the whole life policy. The only difference is under term plan, the person is insured for a specific period only like 10 years, 15years etc. The premium of term plan is the lowest among all types of life insurance policies. Suppose if a person has taken a term plan for say ten years, his nominee or legal heirs get the insurance amount if the person insured dies within the term of the plan (which is ten years in our example). If the person survives the tenure of the policy, he gets nothing in return.</li>
<li><strong>Third is Endowment Policy</strong> - Again this policy is not for the whole life. It&rsquo;s for specific period only. Under this policy, the nominee or the legal heir gets sum assured ( i,e; insurance amount plus a bonus) in event of death of the person insured Bonus is some extra amount which is paid by the insurance company over and above the sum assured. However, if the death of the insured doesn&rsquo;t happen within the tenure of the policy, then he himself gets the sum assured plus the bonus on completion of the term of a life insurance policy. The bonus amount depends on the income earned by the insurance company by investing a certain portion of premium in various assets.</li>
<li><strong>Money Back Policy</strong> - Under this policy, a certain percentage of the insurance amount is paid regularly to the person insured during the lifetime of the policy. That amount may be paid after every three years or say four years or may be even 5 years (depending on the kind of policy that he has taken). However, in event of death of the person insured, the nominee or legal heirs get the full sum assured.</li>
<li><strong>Joint Life Policy</strong> - Under this, there are two or more individuals who are jointly insured. For example, it could be husband and wife or maybe all the partners of a partnership firm. The sum assured is paid at the end of the term of the policy or on death of any one person out of the two people insured whichever is earlier.</li>
<li><strong>Annuity Policy</strong> - This policy is basically for retirement planning. Under this policy, the person insured pays the premium in lump sum or in instalments over a certain period of time. The person insured will receive a specific sum periodically from a specified date onwards, either for life or for fixed number of years. Just to give you an example, the person will get say Rs. 10,000 every month after the age of 40 years and he may receive it throughout the life or only for a certain number of years (depending on the terms and conditions of the plan)</li>
<li><strong>Unit-linked insurance plan or ULIP</strong> -This policy is very similar to the endowment policy. Under endowment policy, ascertain percentage of premium amount is invested by the insurance company in safe investments like government bonds etc. and the bonus is being paid out of the income generated by the insurance company from these investments. So there is not much risk involved in such investments and hence surety of getting a decent bonus amount is much more. Whereas under unit-linked, the investments done by the insurance company are in slightly riskier assets like shares. So the surety of getting a good bonus is not there and you may also end up getting a negligible bonus or maybe even a zero bonus.</li>
